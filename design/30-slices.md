# UI slices

## UI1 — Reusable package, CLI, and GitHub delivery

**Status:** complete

Delivers the generic renderer, custom adapter seam, changelog generator,
protected merge, composite action, and reusable Pages workflow.

Published handoff: npm `subzerodev-platform-ui-landing-page@0.1.0` and source
commit `d2625b7be51585371d9f0b6c0b435c25e6ea4ade`; `v0.1.0` is a convenience
tag. Consumers pin the action by that commit SHA.

## UI2 — Custom-adapter static-head contract

**Status:** complete

Delivers the typed static-head metadata that an existing custom site needs to
retain its canonical URL, social metadata, icons, theme colour and no-script
fallback when it adopts the reusable adapter. The package emits only declared
optional elements and escapes every supplied value. The correction is released
as a new immutable `0.x` package version; consumers continue to pin exactly.

Published handoff: npm `subzerodev-platform-ui-landing-page@0.2.0` from
source commit `69ec6db0de0dce467e5414cfb8ed670f51b117d1`; consumers pin the
package version exactly.
